This project is designed to be a compatibility layer across [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) major versions by always exposing the latest major version API, but have it work for older major versions as well.

This is useful for tool integrations like task runner wrappers or any other tool plugin layers, since it allows them to implement against a single API, leave the node-sass version up to the developer of the individual project, and still be compatible even if the project is a major version ot two behind.

This module is primarily targeted towards tool developer and integrators that create tools for environments they can't entirely control. If you are using node-sass directly in your own project, keep doing so.

**Current API: node.sass 3.x**


Installation and usage
----------------------

Install node-sass-evergreen as a dependency of your project, but don't install node-sass as a dependency. Chosing the specific node-sass version should be up to the consumer of your tool or plugin. You may want to install node-sass as a dev dependency in order to run local tests.

```
npm install --save node-sass-evergreen
npm install --save-dev node-sass
```

In your tool integration include node-sass-evergreen instead of node-sass

```js
var sass = require('node-sass-evergreen');
```

Now you are ready to start using node-sass in your tool. Please refer to the [node-sass README](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) for API specifications.

Example:

```js
sass.render({
  file: './foo.scss',
  outFile: 'foo.css',
  omitSourceMapUrl: true,
  sourceMap: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
}, function (err, result) {
  // Use the resulting output here
});
```
